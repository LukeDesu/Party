### **[âš  IMPORTANT] Project is no longer being mantained**
Due to personal reasons and lack of interest I've decided to stop the development of Party!
There **may** be updates in the future (possibly a full rewrite) but as of now I'll archive the repository until further notice.
Thanks for supporting my small side project for all these years, goodbye ðŸ‘‹

## Features

- many random commands to entertain you and your friends
